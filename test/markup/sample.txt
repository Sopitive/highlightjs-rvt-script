-- I use names like these for my temporary variables:
--
alias temp_int_00 = global.number[0]
alias temp_int_01 = global.number[1]
alias temp_obj_00 = global.object[0]

--
-- Variables that need to remain "pristine" throughout a single game tick, or across
-- multiple game ticks, get more meaningful names:
--
alias sudden_death_enabled   = global.number[2] -- set this to 1 when you want Sudden Death to be active, or 0 otherwise
alias announced_sudden_death = global.number[3] -- only announce the start of Sudden Death once

-- I usually define names like the ones above at the start of the script file.

--
-- Aliases can be block-scoped, so when you're using a temporary variable for something, 
-- you can give it a specific name.
